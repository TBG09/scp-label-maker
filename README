# SCP Label Maker

A simple project to help with creating SCP labels.

Highly customizable, with options such as:

- Overlays
- Text color
- Hazards
- Label types
- And more

---

### Build Requirements

- At least **2–3 GB** of free space
- Python package `colorama` (the build script will attempt to install it automatically, but it may fail on some Linux distros)

You can build using `cargo`, but a helper script is included (mostly works).

---

### Building

#### Windows

```cmd
python build.py -t windows-x64
```

Replace `x64` with `x86` if you’re on a 32-bit system.

#### Linux

```bash
python build.py -t linux-x64
```

Replace `x64` with `x86` if you’re on a 32-bit system.
